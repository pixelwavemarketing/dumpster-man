# Indexing Issues Fix Strategy

## Problem Identified
Google Search Console is showing "Crawled - currently not indexed" for multiple pages, including:
- Service area pages (e.g., `/service-areas/clifton-park`, `/service-areas/troy`)
- Contact page (`/contact`)
- Image assets (though these shouldn't be indexed as pages)

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Robots.txt Blocking Important Pages**
The `robots.txt` file was blocking `/assets/` and `/images/` directories, which interfered with service area pages.

### 2. **Potential Slug Matching Issues**
Service area URLs use hyphens (e.g., "clifton-park") but the matching logic might have issues.

### 3. **Content Quality and SEO Factors**
Pages might not have enough unique content or proper structured data for Google to consider them indexable.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Robots.txt**
```diff
- Disallow: /images/
- Disallow: /assets/
+ # Note: This only blocks direct image access, not pages that contain images
+ Disallow: /*.webp
+ Disallow: /*.png
+ Disallow: /*.jpg
+ Disallow: /*.jpeg
+ Disallow: /*.gif
+ Disallow: /*.svg
+ Disallow: /*.ico

+ # Allow service area pages and other content pages
+ Allow: /service-areas/
+ Allow: /contact
+ Allow: /faq
+ Allow: /dumpster-sizes
```

### 2. **Enhanced Service Area Pages**
- Added comprehensive structured data (JSON-LD)
- Improved meta descriptions and titles
- Added more content sections for better indexing
- Enhanced local business schema markup

### 3. **Improved SEO Elements**
- Better canonical URLs
- Enhanced meta tags
- Comprehensive structured data for local business
- Service area specific content

## Expected Results

### **Immediate Improvements:**
1. **Robots.txt Fix**: Service area pages will no longer be blocked from crawling
2. **Better Content**: Enhanced pages with more comprehensive content
3. **Structured Data**: Rich snippets and better understanding by search engines

### **Long-term Benefits:**
1. **Improved Indexing**: Google should now properly index service area pages
2. **Better Rankings**: Enhanced content and structured data should improve search rankings
3. **Local SEO**: Better local business schema for service area targeting
