# Google Search Console Indexing Issues - Fixes Applied

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. **Page with redirect (3 pages)**
**Problem**: URL mismatches between sitemap and actual routes
**Root Cause**: Sitemap showed `/services` but React routes use `/dumpster-sizes`
**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Updated sitemap.xml to use correct URL: `/dumpster-sizes`
- ✅ Added 301 redirect from `/services` to `/dumpster-sizes` in `_redirects`
- ✅ Updated robots.txt to disallow old `/services` URL

### 2. **Alternate page with proper canonical tag (3 pages)**
**Problem**: Canonical URLs had trailing slashes that didn't match actual routes
**Root Cause**: Canonical tags pointed to URLs with trailing slashes (`/dumpster-sizes/`) but routes don't have them
**Fix Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed canonical URL in Services page: `/dumpster-sizes/` → `/dumpster-sizes`
- ✅ Fixed canonical URL in Contact page: `/contact/` → `/contact`
- ✅ Fixed canonical URL in FAQ page: `/faq/` → `/faq`
